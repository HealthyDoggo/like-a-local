## User Flow

## UI Design

### First Page

- Dark blue (colour scheme) page with large serif font at the top, centred, asking Where are you from?
- Two textboxes, one above of country and one below of city. They need to turn into dropdowns of the applicable options (probably from some basic api or library or something) of countries + cities (the city dropdown should only show the cities from the country that has been selected).

### Second Page

- Dark blue (colour scheme) page with large serif font at the top, centred, asking some easily readable variation of What would you liek tourists to do less?
Three textboxes should be readily available, only one is necessary to move to the next page - more can be added if desired.
Submit button at the bottom of the page.

### Home page
Navbar at the bottom of the page with Settings, profile, and Home buttons.
The home page should be designed similarly to the first page, but it should say Where are you going?

### Tips page
When someone enters where they are going, They should be presented by the answers from locals to the question that tehy initially answered (what would you like tourists to do less), ranked in the backend by the number of answers with a similar embedding value.

### Settings page
Not quite sure what to put here just yet. For now, I guess just a dark mode switch.

### Profile page
This is kinda filler too, but can contain a menu for people to add new answers. I don't want an option to remove old ones just yet as that will be annoying in backend I think.
